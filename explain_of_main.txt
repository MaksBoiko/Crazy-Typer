The TypeSpeedTest class contains the main functionality of the script. It initializes some variables to keep track of the progress of the test,
such as the text to be typed (self.text), the length of each line (self.line_length),
and the position of the cursor in the text (self.now_pos). The keyboard_controller method handles the Esc key to pause or exit the test,
and the print_text_line method prints the text to be typed and highlights the current character being typed.
The type_text method is called every time a key is pressed and updates the progress of the test based on whether
the typed character matches the current character in the text.

The calculate_speed method calculates the typing speed in characters per minute (CPM) and words per minute
(WPM) based on the number of symbols entered (self.symbols_entered) and the time elapsed (self.timer).
The calculate_accuracy method calculates the typing accuracy based on the number of errors made (self.errors_count)
and the number of symbols entered.

The print_statistics method prints the current typing speed, accuracy, number of characters entered, and elapsed time.
The script runs in a loop until the user types all the characters in the text. In each iteration of the loop,
the print_text_line method is called to print the text, the calculate_accuracy and print_statistics methods are called
to update and display the statistics, and the type_text method is called to handle the user's input.

Finally, the plot_table method is called to display a table of the typing speed, accuracy,
and time elapsed at regular intervals (self.step_table).
